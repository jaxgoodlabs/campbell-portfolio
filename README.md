Welcome to my public portfolio for the Fall 2019 Telling Stories with Data course! 

# About me
My name is Patrick Campbell and Iâ€™m a 2nd year student in the Public Policy and Management Master's Program at Carnegie Mellon University. My pronouns are he/him/his. Before coming to CMU, I worked in a variety of positions in the areas of environmental science and conservation. Some of the more notable examples of the work I did include 3 years managing a volunteer program at a biological research station in the Peruvian Amazon and a year and a half hunting and removing invasive Burmese pythons from the areas surrounding Everglades National Park in South Florida. 

I also have many interests and pet projects outside of conservation and environmental science. As a student, I tried on majors ranging from digital media and biology (B.S.) to philosophy (M.A.) and, currently, public policy (M.S.), while dabbling in cognitive science, ecology, and social entrepreneurship. Similarly, as a professional, I've worked variously as an environmental consultant, ecotourism guide, HVAC installation technician, volunteer program manager, special education teacher, and python hunter. My most recent projects have focused on public interest technologies that help to increase the range and accessibility of social services worldwide, especially as a means of increasing society's resilience to global threats like climate change. 

# What I hope to learn
In this course, I hope to learn how to tell more clear and compelling stories with data and make any audience feel like they can immediately engage with the stories I'm telling. I also look forward to the opportunity to learn the software that is setting the new standard of how data should be visualized in professional settings and to build a portfolio through which I can display these new skills to prospective employers.
