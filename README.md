Welcome to my public portfolio for the Fall 2019 Telling Stories with Data course! 

# About me
My name is Patrick Campbell and Iâ€™m a 2nd year student in the Public Policy and Management Master's Program at Carnegie Mellon University. My pronouns are he/him/his. Before coming to CMU, I worked in a variety of positions in the areas of environmental science and conservation. Some of the more notable examples of the work I did include 3 years managing a volunteer program at a biological research station in the Peruvian Amazon and a year and a half hunting and removing invasive Burmese pythons from the areas surrounding Everglades National Park in South Florida. 

I also have many interests and pet projects outside of conservation and environmental science. As a student, I tried on majors ranging from digital media, biology (B.S.), philosophy (M.A.), and, currently, public policy (M.S.), while dabbling in cognitive science, ecology, and social entrepreneurship. As a professional, I've worked as an environmental consultant, tour guide, HVAC installation technician, volunteer program manager, special education teacher, and python hunter. There are very few things I don't find interesting and I see connections everywhere. My big project at the moment is figuring out how to best tie all these things together, especially as I'm attempting to transition back from student to professional. 

# What I hope to learn
In this course, I hope to learn how to tell more clear and compelling stories with data and make any audience feel like they can immediately engage with the stories I'm telling. 

After graduation, I hope to leverage my public policy and data science skill sets toward addressing large-scale collective action problems like climate change.
