# Final Project Part 1: Outline

## Summary
The landscape of regulations and policies surrounding the use and reproduction of data and other information-based goods, particularly in relation to intellectual property protections, has significant consequences on innovation and economic productivity both within the country of origin as well as around the world. 

I want to tell the story of how the unique economics of information-based goods (when paired with other factors) make it possible to improve the social efficiency of related markets through the practice of data sharing. I want to use this story to motivate the argument that universities should lower the protections surrounding the data and other information-based goods they produce.

## Narrative Outline (w/ initial sketches)
**The Information-Based Economy**

Main idea: We’re in a new economic era with new rules
 
Examples of such goods include digital copy media (movies, music, books, etc.), scientific knowledge, and life-saving medicines (pharmaceutical recipes, etc.). But the star of the show is data – “the oil of the 21st century.”

**Economics of Information**

Main idea: The economics of information-based goods is strange, presenting both opportunities and challenges

With traditional goods like apples and refrigerators, the forces of supply and demand coerce producers to set prices equal to the marginal cost (the demand curve is also the marginal cost curve).

In an information-based economy, however, there are many valuable goods that cost nothing to reproduce, and thus have a marginal cost of 0. This situation creates a dilemma for the producers of these goods and justifies the case for intellectual property protections.

**Opportunities**

Main idea: The opportunities are potentially huge, especially for developing countries

The fact that so many goods can be reproduced and distributed at effectively no marginal cost means that there is a lot of room for increasing consumer surplus through sharing, etc. A prime example is data.

**Challenges**

Main idea: IP law serves an important purpose, but is susceptible to abuse

Many economists believe that pricing such goods equal to their marginal cost (as is typical in a competitive market) will remove any incentive companies have to create those goods – i.e., that it will discourage innovation in the information-based economy. The answer to this problem has been Intellectual property laws – patents, copywrites, and other protections that prevent others from using, reproducing, or distributing or otherwise benefiting from the innovations of others.

**Debate**

Main idea: The debate is fierce and strongly influenced by special interests

The evidence is ambiguous: sometimes stronger IP protections seem to help the economies of developing countries, sometimes they seem to hurt. But not all arguments being offered in this debate are equally sincere, or equally valid. It’s important that we separate the signal from the noise, because the stakes are high. 

Incumbents like Hollywood and major record companies frequently pressure governments to increase IP protections, but the economic case is lacking.   

**Challenge**

Main idea: The goal of IP law should be to maximize social efficiency without weakening the incentives for innovation

**Mechanism / How value is created**

Main idea: Data is a valuable economic input that can help small businesses grow and compete

R&D is expensive and strongly dependent on scale. This hurdle makes it difficult for smaller businesses to get off the ground and compete in the marketplace, inhibiting growth. Free data helps lower this hurdle and lets more businesses into the market. This can be seen in the divergent outcomes of US and the EU when the EU decided to adopt a cost-recovery model for government collected data.

**Solution**

Main idea: Universities can help reconcile this divide by adopting open data policies (different incentive structure)

Universities are R&D factories. Patenting is highly concentrated in metropolitan areas and near research universities. While patents provide a potentially valuable source of additional revenues for the university, universities are not generally profit seeking enterprises and university scientists are not primarily driven by a profit motive.  Many donors to universities condition their funds on the university agreeing to some degree of open data policy.

When governments have taken this route, they’ve found that they receive a much larger return on their investment through increased tax revenues from the economic growth their data produces than they would have through more protectionist cost recuperation strategies. 
 
**Call to Action**

Main idea: Universities should lower the protections surrounding the data and other information-based goods they produce. 

## Method and Medium
I want to tell the story of how the unique economics of information-based goods (when paired with other factors) make it possible to improve the social efficiency of certain markets through the practice of data sharing. I want to use this story to motivate the argument that universities should lower the protections surrounding the research data and findings they produce. 

This story is a complex, sprawling one that I’m still considering how to best condense. The narrative outlined below is probably a bit broader than the one I’ll present in the final version. I intend to focus the story on just one or two central data sets that I feel capture the story’s essence most effectively and support my call to action. Right now, it looks like that will be the USPTO data set detailing patent filings by universities and the Department of Education’s data set on university revenues and patent licensing (see descriptions below). The rest of the story I plan to fill in with pictures, key statistics, and text summaries. 

I intend to present the story using the Shorthand digital storytelling tool. The narrative will mostly revolve around data visualizations created with a combination of tools, including DataWrapper, Raw Charts, Tableau, and ArcGIS Pro. I’ll use Excel for data prep and cleaning. Several of the data sets I intend to use (e.g., those compiled by the Center for Measuring University Performance) are contained in PDFs, so I will use Tabula to extract those for import to Excel. 

## The Data
The story I’ve outlined covers a lot of ground and is pretty broad in scope. Because I haven’t had the chance to thoroughly examine all the prospective data sources listed in this section, I anticipate that I may have to remove or gloss over certain sections in the final presentation due to insufficient data. To accommodate this possibility, I have selected a few data sets, highlighted below, to serve as the story’s centerpieces. These mostly focus on the IP policies and data management practices of universities (patent filings, open data policies, etc.) and the economic effects of those policies and practices, both for the university itself as well as “downstream,” i.e., to the various markets and economies these outputs impact. 

These data sets were chosen because they provided what I felt to be the best foundation for a call to action: namely, the lowering of IP protections by universities and adoption of more open data policies. I saw a potential parallel between the situation of universities following the 1980 passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, which gave rights to universities to own inventions and research obtained through federal dollars, and the situation of the European government following the passage of the 1996 European Community (EC) Council Database Directive, which expanded copyright protections over databases, and thought that comparing the economic impacts of these two laws through visualization could be a effective way to drive that point home. 

Other data sets I’ve included track the most common variables used in studies of the relationship between IP protections and economic innovation and productivity. These variables are listed along with example metrics in the next section. While each of these provide interesting subjects for visualization, they’re not as central to the story I want to tell. Consequently, the links associated with these variables may not lead to publicly accessible data. In the case that I’m able to locate publicly accessible data sets for any of these variables, I’ll update this document accordingly.
