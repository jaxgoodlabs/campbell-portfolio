# Final Project Part 1: Outline

## Summary
The landscape of regulations and policies surrounding the use and reproduction of data and other information-based goods, particularly in relation to intellectual property protections, has significant consequences on innovation and economic productivity both within the country of origin as well as around the world. 

I want to tell the story of how the unique economics of information-based goods (when paired with other factors) make it possible to improve the social efficiency of related markets through the practice of data sharing. I want to use this story to motivate the argument that universities should lower the protections surrounding the data and other information-based goods they produce.

## Narrative Outline (w/ initial sketches)
**Ch. 1: The Information-Based Economy**

Main idea: We’re in a new economic era with new rules
 
Examples of such goods include digital copy media (movies, music, books, etc.), scientific knowledge, and life-saving medicines (pharmaceutical recipes, etc.). But the star of the show is data – “the oil of the 21st century.”

**Ch. 2: Economics of Information**

Main idea: The economics of information-based goods is strange, presenting both opportunities and challenges

With traditional goods like apples and refrigerators, the forces of supply and demand coerce producers to set prices equal to the marginal cost (the supply curve is also the marginal cost curve). 

<p align="center">

In an information-based economy, however, there are many valuable goods that cost nothing to reproduce, and thus have a marginal cost of 0. This situation creates a dilemma for the producers of these goods and justifies the case for intellectual property protections.

**Ch. 3: Opportunities**

Main idea: The opportunities are potentially huge, especially for developing countries

The fact that so many goods can be reproduced and distributed at effectively no marginal cost means that there is a lot of room for increasing consumer surplus through sharing, etc. A prime example is data.

**Ch. 4: Challenges**

Main idea: IP law serves an important purpose, but is susceptible to abuse

Many economists believe that pricing such goods equal to their marginal cost (as is typical in a competitive market) will remove any incentive companies have to create those goods – i.e., that it will discourage innovation in the information-based economy. The answer to this problem has been Intellectual property laws – patents, copywrites, and other protections that prevent others from using, reproducing, or distributing or otherwise benefiting from the innovations of others.

**Ch. 5: The Debate**

Main idea: The debate is fierce and strongly influenced by special interests

The evidence is ambiguous: sometimes stronger IP protections seem to help the economies of developing countries, sometimes they seem to hurt. But not all arguments being offered in this debate are equally sincere, or equally valid. It’s important that we separate the signal from the noise, because the stakes are high. 

Incumbents like Hollywood and major record companies frequently pressure governments to increase IP protections, but the economic case is lacking.   

**Ch. 6: Challenge**

Main idea: The goal of IP law should be to maximize social efficiency without weakening the incentives for innovation

**Ch. 7: Mechanism of value creation**

Main idea: Data is a valuable economic input that can help small businesses grow and compete

R&D is expensive and strongly dependent on scale. This hurdle makes it difficult for smaller businesses to get off the ground and compete in the marketplace, inhibiting growth. Free data helps lower this hurdle and lets more businesses into the market. This can be seen in the divergent outcomes of US and the EU when the EU decided to adopt a cost-recovery model for government collected data.

**Ch. 8: Solution**

Main idea: Universities can help reconcile this divide by adopting open data policies (different incentive structure)

Universities are R&D factories. Patenting is highly concentrated in metropolitan areas and near research universities. While patents provide a potentially valuable source of additional revenues for the university, universities are not generally profit seeking enterprises and university scientists are not primarily driven by a profit motive.  Many donors to universities condition their funds on the university agreeing to some degree of open data policy.

When governments have taken this route, they’ve found that they receive a much larger return on their investment through increased tax revenues from the economic growth their data produces than they would have through more protectionist cost recuperation strategies. 
 
**Ch. 9: Call to Action**

Main idea: Universities should lower the protections surrounding the data and other information-based goods they produce. 

## Method and Medium
I want to tell the story of how the unique economics of information-based goods (when paired with other factors) make it possible to improve the social efficiency of certain markets through the practice of data sharing. I want to use this story to motivate the argument that universities should lower the protections surrounding the research data and findings they produce. 

This story is a complex, sprawling one that I’m still considering how to best condense. The narrative outlined below is probably a bit broader than the one I’ll present in the final version. I intend to focus the story on just one or two central data sets that I feel capture the story’s essence most effectively and support my call to action. Right now, it looks like that will be the USPTO data set detailing patent filings by universities and the Department of Education’s data set on university revenues and patent licensing (see descriptions below). The rest of the story I plan to fill in with pictures, key statistics, and text summaries. 

I intend to present the story using the Shorthand digital storytelling tool. The narrative will mostly revolve around data visualizations created with a combination of tools, including DataWrapper, Raw Charts, Tableau, and ArcGIS Pro. I’ll use Excel for data prep and cleaning. Several of the data sets I intend to use (e.g., those compiled by the Center for Measuring University Performance) are contained in PDFs, so I will use Tabula to extract those for import to Excel. 

## The Data
The story I’ve outlined covers a lot of ground and is pretty broad in scope. Because I haven’t had the chance to thoroughly examine all the prospective data sources listed in this section, I anticipate that I may have to remove or gloss over certain sections in the final presentation due to insufficient data. To accommodate this possibility, I have selected a few data sets, highlighted below, to serve as the story’s centerpieces. These mostly focus on the IP policies and data management practices of universities (patent filings, open data policies, etc.) and the economic effects of those policies and practices, both for the university itself as well as “downstream,” i.e., to the various markets and economies these outputs impact. 

These data sets were chosen because they provided what I felt to be the best foundation for a call to action: namely, the lowering of IP protections by universities and adoption of more open data policies. I saw a potential parallel between the situation of universities following the 1980 passage of the Bayh-Dole Act, which gave rights to universities to own inventions and research obtained through federal dollars, and the situation of the European government following the passage of the 1996 European Community (EC) Council Database Directive, which expanded copyright protections over databases, and thought that comparing the economic impacts of these two laws through visualization could be a effective way to drive that point home. 

Other data sets I’ve included track the most common variables used in studies of the relationship between IP protections and economic innovation and productivity. These variables are listed along with example metrics in the next section. While each of these provide interesting subjects for visualization, they’re not as central to the story I want to tell. Consequently, the links associated with these variables may not lead to publicly accessible data. In the case that I’m able to locate publicly accessible data sets for any of these variables, I’ll update this document accordingly. 

#### Variables
This project focuses on relationships between the following variables:

1.	Economic Productivity / Efficiency
  * Per capita GDP

2.	Innovation
  * USPTO patent filings (by universities?)
  * Global Innovation Index

3.	Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
  * FDI Regulatory Restrictiveness Index (FDI Index) measures statutory restrictions on foreign direct investment in 58 countries, including all OECD and G20 countries, and covers 22 sectors.

#### Deadweight loss incurred by IP
The concept here would be to reimagine common graphs used in economic analysis, especially supply-demand curves. The economics of information have a tendency to turn classical economic trends on their heads, generating a lot of surprising insights in the process. The sketch below is almost certainly inaccurate, but attempts to represent something that economists have noted about IP protections - namely, that they tend to concentrate surplus on the producer side when strengthened (mimicking a monopoly scenario) and concentrate surple on the consumer side when weakened, with deadweight loss being distributed between those two extremes.

# Final Project Part 2: User Research and Prototyping

## Wireframes and Storyboards

Links to the prototype before and after incorporating user feedback are accessible at the following links.

[Link to first prototype](https://preview.shorthand.com/bQYFxE4dcP104j5N)

[Link to revised prototype incorporating user feedback](https://preview.shorthand.com/rbaX9nh7wMMEMQku)

## User Research Protocol

**Target Audience**

This story targets general audiences, but especially people associated with the university system (students, professors, etc.) and those interested in public policy and economic development.

**Approach**

My user research approach is to use user research surveys to obtain feedback on the clarity and persuasiveness of my story. I intend to survey 3 individuals matching the criteria described above – one person outside the university system and without special interest or knowledge of the topics addressed (representing general audiences) and two graduate students from the Heinz public policy school at Carnegie Mellon University. I intend to survey friends and acquaintances who I can trust to provide honest critical feedback on the elements of the story.

In order to focus feedback on the story-telling quality of the visualizations themselves (i.e., independently of the supporting text), I will compile the visualizations in a separate folder numbered by their order in the story. This approach will preserve the logical flow of the narrative without allowing the textual narrative to fill in the gaps. Because I have so many images, I will also use this opportunity to help identify the 3 or so graphs that are most integral to the story I want to tell, and/or that my audience intuitively sense tells the most compelling story. If there is rough consensus after my three interviews, I plan to focus my redesigns on those visualizations, leaving the others as contextual, or if necessary, removing them altogether.

Since the storyboard is in a digital format, I’ll record the interviewee’s comments on a scrap piece of paper, leaving them free to examine the visualization. 

**Interview Script**

Hi (name of interviewee), would you mind providing your feedback on some data visualizations? The purpose of the exercise is to help me better understand what makes a visualization effective, particularly in how clearly it communicates its intended message to its target audience. 

[General thoughts and impressions]

First, I’d like for you to browse the entire collection of visualizations for 2 to 3 minutes and just note any general thoughts, feelings, and impressions. 

(Wait ~3 minutes)

  * What are your main thoughts, feelings, and impressions about these visualizations?

  * What did these visualizations mean to you, taken as a collection? 

  * Did you feel like there was any central story connecting the visualizations? If so, what was that story?

  * Do you feel the visualizations made you want to respond in some way / do something? If so, what?

  * What 3 graphs do you feel most completely captured the central story as you understood it / were most integral? 

[Specific graphs - Using just the 3 graphs identified above]

*Visualization 1:* (description of visualization)

  * In one sentence, can you tell me why you selected this visualization?

  * What is the first thing you noticed about this visualization? Why?

  * Did anything about this visualization surprise you? If so, what?

  * What does this visualization mean to you, if anything?

  * How do you feel about the colors, fonts, and other aesthetic features of the graph? Do you feel those feelings are consistent or inconsistent with the message of the visualization?

  * If you could change something about this graph, what would it be and why?

*Visualization 2:* (Repeat for visualizations 2 and 3)

[Revisit story]

  * Now that you’ve had a bit more time to interact with the visualizations, have any of your perceptions changed? If so, how?

  * How about the story? Do you feel the data tells the same story as you thought before, or a different one? 

  * Can you elaborate on how you felt it’s changed? What was it specifically that you feel caused the story to change for you?

Thank you for your time!

**Findings**

Common themes identified from the user research include:

  * Story did not feel unified – was open to multiple, conflicting interpretations (when no additional context provided). “A lot of left turns."
      - Major elements / alternative loci of story could have been any of the following - Innovation, technology, IP, patents, universities, climate change, etc.
  
  * Most common interpretations were: 
      - Stronger IP protections were good for economies and should be used more strategically by universities 
      - Open data is good for economies and should be used more strategically by universities.
  * Most commonly identified graphs for integrality to narrative
    - Economic value of open data by sector (aggregate bar graph)
    - Economic competitiveness by strength of IP (linear regression graph)
    - Bowtie illustrations of effects of IP on allocation of surplus
    - Patent royalties as percentage of total university revenues (table)
    - Carbon tech transfer (bar chart)
  * “Bowtie” illustration was compelling but confusing – labels were unclear, message was unclear, but communicated a sense of something important
    - “Colors capture more than words, but have to go to words to understand what colors mean.”
    -  Seems to emphasize a comparison between two things. “Looks like they originate from a single source, but then become something completely different, or opposite.” 
    
  * Very few aesthetic complaints about gray-scale graphs – helped with clarity
  * Most common complaint about graphs was lack of time indexing and unclear x and y labels
  * Most surprising elements were
    - Gap between clusters of countries in IP strength by economic competitiveness linear regression graph
    - “Dead space” in center of bowtie illustration
  * No call to action very clear, but possibilities included:
    - Support open data
    - Support strong IP protections for university patents
    - IP laws have some effect on how well countries deal with climate change 
  * Conflict between IP protections and open data did not seem to be clear from the visualizations alone.
  * Some graphs described as “very weird” – bowtie illustration, break-apart diagram of patented technologies, etc.
  * In the several bar graphs, first thing respondents noticed were the biggest bars with the brightest color (when multiple colors used). 

#### Changes Implemented 

In response to the feedback of prospective users, I made the following changes:

  * Focused redesign efforts on 5 most integral graphs
    - Stair-step bar graph showing economic potential of open data
    - Linear regression graph of global competitiveness against strength of IP protections
    - Effect of strength of IP laws on allocation of surplus (bowtie graph)
    - Number of patents by university (graduated point map)
    - Patent royalties as a proportion of university revenues (table)
  * Sketched redesigns for the above graphs to address most common critiques
    - Stair-step bar graph
      - I tried eliminating the weird stair step gray space in the middle and moving that information to the bottom. The first redraw used different scales for the per-sector graph and aggregate tally on the bottom, which I found confusing, so I tried another approach with a stair step line graph, both with and without fill. The filled version retains a lot of the bar graph feel of the original but without the sense of dead space in the middle, which I liked. 
    - Linear regression
      - I broke up the two clusters by color and added a reference point in IP law to explain the possible gap – namely, the adoption of the TRIPs agreement.
    - Bowtie graph
      - I decided to try a more traditional presentation to represent the change in allocation of surplus as a function of strength of IP using a series of classic supply-and-demand curves alongside a slider controlling strength of IP protections. I considered turning this into a slide animation somehow.
    - Table
      - Converted to bar graph highlighting patent royalties as a proportion of total revenues.
  * I removed several inessential elements to simplify the story and maintain a high level of generality
    - Bar graph on the benefits of tech transfer
    - The debate section contrasting the two main positions on the issue
    - The section describing the mechanism of value generation
